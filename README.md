# SCIT
Task Repository for SCIT


## Instructions

After cloning the repository, to generate graphs, run the `generator.py` script.
The Graphs directory consists of 100 experiments. Each experiment is divided into the following:

* Histogram generated from `np.random.normal` ( Blue )
* Histogram generated from `np.random.poisson` ( Orange )
* Average Histogram generated by taking 100 random points which are the mean of poission and normal data. ( Green )

The dataset for each of the curve is given in the file `data.csv`, and histogram for each curve is in `graph.png`

The mean of each curve is denoted by the experiment no.

eg: The Graph generated in `Experiment10` is generated with mean `10`
i.e:
`np.random.poisson(lam=10)` and `np.random.normal(loc=10)`

## Observations

* The Histogram generated using `np.random.normal` follows the curve of a normal probability distribution.

* The Histogram generated using `np.random.poisson` follows the poission probability distribution.

* The Peak of each histogram is located at the mean of the curves.


Eg: 

* Normal for `Experiment 4` (Mean 4)

* Poisson for `Experiment 5` (Mean 5)

* Average for ` Experiment 6` (Mean 6)
